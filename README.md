# Sura
![](src/images/Sura.png)

Sura is a URL shortner application, which simply means an application that takes an valid URL as an input and gives you the shortest form of that URL.

Sura is built with great user experience, interaction and experience.

Sura design and images were gotten from [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

Sura is also a [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenge which I completed, you can view the challenge and attempt it [Here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G)

Sura also has a local memory that keeps track of all URL a user have shortened over time and shows them.

Sura is also responsive on all devices ranging from Desktop, Tablets and smart phones.

This Project is built 100% with ReactJS and CSS, [Shorto](https://shrtco.de/) API was used in this application to send the URL to the server for processing, Local storage served as the local memory to store links any user has shortened.

Sura also depends on an internet connection to work as it is a web application that runs on the browser.

You can view the live application [here](https://suraa.netlify.app/)

Do vist the site and Shorten a URL now!!

If you are a developer and you intend to look into this project and it codes, kindly follow the instruction below to set the project up on your local machine.

Happy Coding!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
